Cloud Computing

## Definition
Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet, allowing users to access and utilize various resources such as storage, servers, databases, software, and applications without the need for on-premises infrastructure.

## Service Models

-Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources such as virtual machines, storage, and networks, allowing users to build their own infrastructure on the cloud.

-Platform as a Service (PaaS): Offers a platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications without the need to manage underlying infrastructure.

-Software as a Service (SaaS): Provides ready-to-use software applications over the internet, eliminating the need for installation and maintenance.

## Deployment Models

-Public Cloud: Services are offered over the internet by third-party providers and are accessible to the general public.

-Private Cloud: Infrastructure is dedicated to a single organization and may be managed internally or by a third-party provider.

-Hybrid Cloud: Combines both public and private clouds, allowing organizations to leverage the benefits of both while maintaining control over sensitive data.

-Community Cloud: Shared infrastructure that serves a specific community or industry with similar requirements and concerns.

## Load Balancing

Load balancing is the distribution of workloads across multiple resources to ensure optimal performance and availability. It evenly spreads incoming requests to prevent overload on a single server and improve efficiency.
